    <h1>C Language</h1><br>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. 
    It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. 
    The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, 
    and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development. 
    Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).
